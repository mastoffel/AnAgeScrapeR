# AnAgeScrapeR

AnAgeScrapeR lets you extract data for one or more species from the AnAge database:
[http://genomics.senescence.info/species/](http://genomics.senescence.info/species/). The 
official citation is:

Tacutu, R., Thornton, D., Johnson, E., Budovsky, A., Barardo, D., Craig, T., Diana, E., Lehmann, G., Toren, D., Wang, J., Fraifeld, V. E., de Magalhaes, J. P. (2018) "Human Ageing Genomic Resources: new and updated databases." Nucleic Acids Research 46(D1):D1083-D1090.



## Installation

You can install AnAgeScrapeR from GitHub. Dependencies are all from the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/). 

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("mastoffel/AnAgeScrapeR", dependencies = TRUE)
```

## Example

So far, only the latin species names can be used (case insensitive). By default, there should
be a space between Genus and Species name, but other delimiters can be used with the name_sep argument.
The database is downloaded into your working directory (as it's a zip file which is difficult to
directly read into R) when you extract data for the first time. Afterwards you can set download_data to FALSE,
except for you want to download it again to be sure you have the newest version. 

```{r example}
library(AnAgeScrapeR)
species <- c("felis catus", "Sterna paradisaea")
dat <- scrape_AnAge(latin_name = species,
                    vars = c("maximum_longevity_yrs","female_maturity_days"))
dat
```

There are quite a few more life history traits to extract, which can be found in AnAge_variables.
The unit in which a variable is measured is simply the last bit of the variable name. 

```{r example2}
data(AnAge_variables)
AnAge_variables
```
